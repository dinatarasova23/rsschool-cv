## About myself
I started my professional career in 2008, have worked 3 years in credit departments of several banks and then 7 years in the financial department of a manufacturing company.
In 2019 I moved to Peru, finishing my career due to the birth of the child.
Now I want to learn a new intellectual profession, where you need to come up with solutions, not routine work as I had in my previous job. Front-end development seems to be very interesting and promising for me. I liked Math in school and won many regional math competitions.
I participated in Work&Travel program, spent 4 months working in the USA in 2007.
Among my strengths I want to note perseverance and diligence, ability to learn languages, analytical mind, honesty and responsibility.
